   This module is designed to encapusalte the behavior
of likelihood selection functions used to separate 
particular event samples in the ATMPD analysis. Further 
it is intended to provide an intercace to these functions
provided an ATMPD ROOTuple has been loaded into a 
DataManager object (see $ATMPD_ROOT/src/analysis/Osc3++/tools ).

//  Library 
//
////////////////////////////////////

compile: 
  > gmake lib 


Library: libeventselectionll.a

Depends on: 
    -losctools  -losc3ppcore

These libraries should also be linked into any executable 
with to -leventselectionll.

The systematic error  ($ATMD_ROOT/src/analysis/syserr.database ) and
OscNtupleBuilder librariers ($ATMD_ROOT/src/analysis/OscNtupleBuilder) 
are examples of software that rely on this library

LikelihoodManager.*

   - Class for managing and interfacing to LikelihoodReturn objects
   - On instantiation can be used to remotely attain event-by-event 
     values of the relevant likelihoods
   - One likelihood for the Multi-Ring Multi-GeV e-like sample exists
   - One likelihood for the Pi0 Selection likelihood also exists

LikelihoodReturn.*
   - Base class for retrieving likelihood distributions for each
     varable in the likelihood computation. 

mrmgeLikelihood.*
   - Derived class of LikelihoodReturn
   - Provides steering for production of the likelihood function used 
     to create the ATMPD Multi-Ring Multi-GeV e-like sample  (parent 
     sample for nue-like and nuebar-like samples)

nuebarLikelihood.*
   - Derived class of LikelihoodReturn
   - Provides steering for production of the likelihood function used 
     to create the ATMPD Multi-Ring Multi-GeV nue-like and 
     nuebar like samples 

Pi0Likelihood.*
   - Derived class of LikelihoodReturn
   - Provides steering for production of Pi0 likelihood function 
     used to create the Sub-GeV Single-Ring Pi0 sample


////////////////////////////////////
//
//  executables for building likelihoods
//
////////////////////////////////////

build_pi0likelihood.cc
build_mgmrelikelihood.cc
build_nuebarlikelihood.cc

Each of these executables has the following usage:

 > ./build_pi0likelihood skx card cpu ncpus 
    where: 
           skx   = [ sk1, sk2, sk3, sk4 ] 
           card  = Input card file 
           cpu   = number of this cpu [0, ncpus -1] 
           ncpus = total number of cpus used to process

Note that the nuebar likelihood can only be built after the 
likelihood from the build_mgmrelikelihood process exists
